System design interviews can feel overwhelming at first—there are so many concepts, trade-offs, and building blocks to understand. That’s why I’ve decided to create this **step-by-step blog series** that will walk you through the most important system design fundamentals in a clear, structured way.

Think of this page as your hub. All the lessons will be linked here as individual blog posts so you can follow along at your own pace.
